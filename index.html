													<h3>Wardrobe wonders</h3>
												</header>
												<p>After this session, you'll know what suits your body shape and colouring and how to coordinate and accessorise your existing wardrobe. We'll rediscover any forgotten gems and decide what could be altered to give it new life. I'll take everything else away and donate it to charity (so you don't have to). By the end, you'll have a beautifully organised wardrobe that you know how to wear - perfect!

This takes between 3-4 hours and costs £150.</p>

													<h3>Shopping together</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In advance of our day together I'll source wonderful clothes and accessories that will suit you, meet your brief and keep you within budget. On the day there's no hassle, no wasted time and always a good place to refuel with a bite to eat and a coffee. All you have to do is relax and enjoy your transformation.

This takes about six hours, including a break for lunch and costs £275.

If you have limited time or a small shopping list, we can have a half-day session for £150.</p>

													<h3>Shopping for you</h3>
												</header>
												<p>If you don't have time or the inclination for a day's shopping, I can source everything based on your budget, what you need and when you need it by, and bring it to your home or office.

The pricing for this service depends on your brief and timeline.

												</header>
												<p>Weddings can be stressful and mothers of the bride and groom in particular can really worry about looking their best on the day. I'll work with your wedding party to make sure they all look and feel good on the day and make sure everyone's choices complement each other.

The cost of this session depends on the number of people involved but the costs are the same rate as other sessions. There's no stealth wedding tax!

													<h3>Judith Rosten</h3>
												</header>
												<p>"I got in touch with Miss Harding/Sam to help me out of a post-baby baggy practical clothing rut. I didn't want to spend much on new clothes but rather rediscover the wardrobe I had, clear out the dead wood, and regain my confidence in putting more flattering outfits together. And this is exactly what Sam/Miss Harding helped me achieve! By the end of an enjoyable afternoon trying on every item in my wardrobe, during which Sam/Miss Harding made me feel very comfortable and at ease, and helped me see how different items could be worn together, I had a big pile for the charity shop and could actually see the nice clothes I had lost in my previously overstuffed wardrobe. I now feel much more myself, and enjoy chosing what to wear each day. Thank you Sam!"

													<h3>Izzy</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Having had two children and suddenly having less time to look for good buys, as well as a slightly different body shape than before, I found Miss Harding’s services were incredibly useful.  We had a good chat beforehand to discuss what kind of clothes I was looking for, what I already had in my wardrobe and she made some great suggestions about the kinds of styles that would suit my post kids figure and lifestyle.  She did all the legwork and not only found stuff that was exactly what I was looking for but she also encouraged me to try on items that I would not have picked up off the rails, which to my surprise suited me brilliantly.  She also gave me some great advice about accessorizing and putting looks together with a stylish and contemporary twist.  My shopping trip with her was fun and productive – she kept to her brief, we kept within budget and the compliments I’ve received since have made me seriously consider a second session very soon.</p>

													<h3>Barnaby</h3>

												<p>Sam transformed my look and image and made me realise so many important things about looking good and buying clothes that suited me and my body shape - the finest example being that I did not have big hips; the terrible trousers that I was buying before I met her did! She has given me complete confidence in shopping for myself for the first time in my life!</p>

													<h3>Jane</h3>

												<p>I would recommend taking style advice from Miss Harding. After just one session I was able to discard loads of unsuitable clothing from my wardrobe and now know what suits me. She also advised me on what to wear for a job interview. I didn't get the job but I turned heads on the Strand AND got chatted up in a shoe shop so I know I looked good!</p>

													<h3>Who is Miss Harding?</h3>
													
												</header>
												<p>I love personal styling because whether I've spent an afternoon with a client sorting through their wardrobe or we've enjoyed a day together buying beautiful clothes, they're always so amazed and excited at the change in how they look. In some ways nothing's really changed, it's still them, with the same body and the same doubts but somehow looking good has the power to make people feel better.

People have different abilities and mine is that I have a natural eye for style - I can look at something and just know if the pattern, cut or combination is right. And after many years of looking for the best and most interesting shops, I know where to find things too!

From a personal perspective, after an illness and surgery some years ago, I was grateful for this skill and came to a deeper appreciation of the power of looking good when you're not necessarily feeling it. 

So I don't focus on the latest fashions in the sense of what we 'should' be wearing. I'm more interested in finding my clients the best, most beautiful and most flattering clothes and accessories for them. And making sure the process is fun and transformative.

If you decide to work with me, I'll do this for you too. Please do get in touch and we can talk about what you want and take it from there.</p>
